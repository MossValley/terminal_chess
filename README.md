# Terminal Chess

This is the [Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project) of The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course. The task was to build a chess game for two humans players to play on the command line. This project builds on all the lessons learnt in this part of the course.

The coding of the pieces movements are largely based on [this](https://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html) description of the moves of chess. 

** Shortcomings **
* Game only warns for 'check', not 'checkmate'
* Graphical interface is messy

** Features to add **
* Checkmate
* Computer player?
